# Yelp Dataset Challenge
Project 2 Group 1 - Mike Amodeo and Tom Seddon

A fundamental question for any entrepreneur interested in opening a business that serves customers from a physical location is being able to identify where the best opportunities exist in a given market.

Traditional approaches to this problem range from a reliance on the gut instinct of a good local real estate broker who ‘knows the market’ to complex modelling of local demographic, population and journey-time data. Both of these approaches have shortcomings. Reliance on a broker makes it difficult for an entrepreneur to be comfortable that all options have been considered, not just the ones the broker personally knows about or is incented to sell. Reliance on a complex demographic model can make it difficult for the entrepreneur to understand the specific logic of why each location is scored high or low, and also often involves complex tuning of the model’s parameters by business category.

Our project created a way to identify promising business opportunities in a market that addresses the issues with traditional approaches by combining a solid data-driven foundation with transparent logic. This provides the entrepreneur with the assurance that they are looking across the whole market and that they understand very clearly why the selected areas have been identified.

We do this by using data made available from Yelp, a local business review company. We demonstrate how Yelp’s data on business locations and customer feedback about those locations can be used both to identify areas which appear to have strong demand for a particular service and to identify areas that appear to have weak competition.

This approach demonstrates a service that does not seem to exist and that we believe might be valuable enough for Yelp to sell to entrepreneurs and commercial real estate brokers, either as a standalone service or bundled as additional value in an advertising package.

# Files

The two PDFs in this directory include both the final report and the presentation slides submitted to Yelp as our entry. The work was done primarily in Jupyter notebooks, and those files are included in this directory as well. Notebooks beginning with "Exploratory" show our initial exploratory analysis. Notebooks with "Calculations" in the name represent the most complete calculations of how we evaluated demand and supply. These should also show how we mapped them out. The Report Graphics notebook includes several plots included in the report and presentation.

The input data files are not included because they were very large files.

Maps were created in two ways. First, report graphics utilized mplleaflet in Python. Those output files are saved as html files in the "maps" subdirectory. We also created maps using Google Maps that can be accessed at the links below:
